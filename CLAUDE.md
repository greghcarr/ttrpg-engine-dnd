# dnd-srd-engine — working manual

A standalone, event-sourced TypeScript domain engine for D&D 5.5e (2024 rules). Schema-only library; consumers supply content packs. GitHub repo: `github.com/greghcarr/dnd-srd-engine`. Not currently distributed via npm (the alpha.0-alpha.5 releases were unpublished in May 2026 on IP-cleanup grounds; see CHANGELOG).

**This file is the working manual.** It is auto-loaded into the context of any Claude Code instance opened in this repo. Read it end-to-end before opening anything else. The conventions below are non-negotiable; the architecture below is locked.

## Quality bar

**Incorrect code is worse than no code.** This engine is designed to be the foundation other D&D tools rely on. A subtly-wrong rule implementation that *looks* correct will mislead consumers for months. Hold every change to that standard:

- If you cannot make a change correct, leave it deferred with a tracked row in [docs/starter-pack-gaps.md](docs/starter-pack-gaps.md) and document the RAW deviation in the slice's CHANGELOG entry.
- Cite the SRD when content judgments are involved (see "SRD is canon" below). Never substitute web sources.
- The full test suite must be green and `tsc --noEmit` must be clean before every commit. No exceptions.
- Each commit ships one coherent slice. See "Slice cadence" below.

Everything below exists to keep that bar.

## Fresh-agent quickstart

If you (Claude or otherwise) are arriving at this repo for the first time, do this in order:

1. Skim [README.md](README.md) for the user-facing pitch, the roadmap, and the current "Status" section.
2. Read this file end-to-end. The norms in "Working norms" apply to every commit.
3. Confirm `references/srd-markdown/` exists in your worktree. If absent, ask before proceeding — never substitute web sources for SRD content. See "SRD is canon" below.
4. Read the priority queue at [docs/starter-pack-gaps.md](docs/starter-pack-gaps.md). The "Future engine slices" table and "Deferred primitives backlog" are the next-slice candidates, sorted roughly by cohort payoff.
5. Pick a slice, follow [docs/slice-template.md](docs/slice-template.md), commit to `dev`, surface the work to the user.

If anything in the working norms below conflicts with how you would normally operate, the norms win.

## Working norms (read first)

### Branch structure

- `main`: stable, releasable. Tagged versions live here. Never commit slice work directly to main.
- `dev`: daily slice work. All slice commits land here first.
- The user (Greg) merges `dev` into `main` on his cadence, typically when a coherent group of slices is ready to surface.
- Branch off `dev` (it has the latest slice work). Commit to `dev`. Do not push or merge to main yourself; surface the work and let the user decide. Branching off `main` would lose recent dev commits.
- For multi-track parallel work (engine slices + content authoring), see [docs/parallel-authoring.md](docs/parallel-authoring.md). Worktrees still commit to `dev` (or to per-worktree feature branches that merge to `dev`).

### Commit, don't push

- Treat `git commit` as a **local-only** operation.
- Never run `git push` (or any other remote-modifying operation: `git push --force`, `git push origin`, branch deletions on origin, etc.) unless the user explicitly asks.
- Never run `git commit --amend`, `git rebase`, `git reset --hard`, or any history-rewriting operation without explicit instruction.
- Never skip hooks (`--no-verify`) or bypass signing without explicit instruction.
- If a pre-commit hook fails, fix the underlying issue and create a NEW commit. Do not amend the failed commit.

### SRD is canon. Use the local clone.

- `references/srd-markdown/` is the **only** source of truth for SRD 5.2.1 rules text (spells, monsters, magic items, conditions, classes, species, backgrounds, feats).
- **Never WebFetch D&D content.** Web sources (Roll20 wiki, dndbeyond, third-party fan sites) are 2014-PHB-flavored or third-party variants and have introduced drift bugs in past slices.
- If you need an SRD lookup, grep `references/srd-markdown/`. The drift audit at [tests/audit/srd-drift.test.ts](tests/audit/srd-drift.test.ts) catches regressions automatically.
- The markdown ships as a **git submodule** pointing to [`github.com/greghcarr/dnd-5e-srd-markdown`](https://github.com/greghcarr/dnd-5e-srd-markdown) (CC-BY-4.0). Clone the repo with `git clone --recurse-submodules`, or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` post-clone, to populate it. If the directory is empty after clone, that's the cause.
- The PDF source at `references/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf` (heavy, downloadable from WotC) stays gitignored. The markdown is the canonical surface; the PDF is for occasional spot-checking.

Detailed SRD layout under "SRD source of truth" below.

### Slice cadence: primitive + canonical user

Each commit ships one focused unit. Three valid slice shapes:

1. **Engine primitive + canonical user**: a new effect kind, TriggerAction, planner, schema field, or condition + 1-2 RAW spells / features / items that exercise it.
2. **Content sweep**: pure JSON wires that exercise an existing primitive. No engine work.
3. **Doc / workflow / infra change**: rare. This file's most recent rewrite is an example.

See recent commits via `git log --oneline | head -40` for the pattern. Slices 88-122 are the most representative of the per-slice rhythm; slices 235-243 are recent examples of the primitive + canonical user cadence on the UseItem / ConsumeItem surface.

Detailed checklists per slice shape live in [docs/slice-template.md](docs/slice-template.md).

### Pre-commit Uncle Bob audit

Before every engine slice commit, write a 5-8-line audit in the commit message body covering:

- **Names**: are the new identifiers intention-revealing? Did you reuse the naming convention of the surrounding code?
- **DRY**: did you copy something instead of factoring? If so, justify in one line. Single-call-site duplication of < 10 lines is usually below the abstraction threshold; document the call when you decline.
- **SRP**: does each new function / module do one thing at one level of abstraction?
- **Magic numbers**: extracted to named constants? RAW values cited?
- **at-threading** (when the slice emits events): single `nowIso()` resolution per planner, passed through to every emitted event.
- **Mechanical outcomes asserted**: which observable behaviors do your tests pin?
- **Tests**: which bugs does each new test prevent? Did you over-test?

The audit is **mandatory** for engine slices. Pure content sweeps (JSON wires only) can use a shorter audit confirming the new wires match RAW.

The audit is a discipline tool, not paperwork: writing it forces you to notice the issues you would otherwise ship. If you cannot defend a decision in one line, reconsider it before committing.

### Doc updates per slice

At the close of every slice, update the docs the slice touched:

- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) — **always**. One entry per slice under `## Unreleased`. Include the Uncle Bob audit summary.
- [docs/starter-pack-gaps.md](docs/starter-pack-gaps.md) — when a deferred row is closed (strike it through with `~~...~~`), when a new deferral is noted, or when "Coverage at a glance" counts change.
- [docs/api-overview.md](docs/api-overview.md) — when the public surface changes.
- [docs/status.md](docs/status.md) — when "Known gaps" closes, when a status row's cell shifts, or when the test count moves significantly.
- [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) — when a phase-level milestone closes.
- [README.md](README.md) — only when the at-a-glance Status / Roadmap summary needs to reflect the new state. Most slices don't touch README directly.

### Doc size discipline (the single-Read ceiling)

Index-type docs in this repo (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/status.md, docs/roadmap.md, docs/starter-pack-gaps.md, and every file under docs/changelog/) must each fit in a single Read tool call. The Claude Code Read tool refuses files over **~25,000 tokens** (roughly **60 KB** for our dense technical prose, give or take). Beyond that ceiling an agent has to read with offset/limit, which is fine for spot lookups but breaks the fresh-agent discovery path (the very first Read on the front-door doc errors out).

**How to check** if a file fits:

- `wc -c <file>` — anything safely under **60,000 bytes** will fit. **40-50 KB** is comfortable; **55+** is borderline and worth verifying with an actual Read.
- Or, attempt to read the file with the Read tool (no offset/limit). If it returns the content, you're fine. If it errors with "exceeds maximum allowed tokens", split it.

**When a file gets too big**, split with the playbook below. Don't bypass with offset/limit — the goal is that any agent or contributor can read the front-door doc in one call.

**Splitting playbook:**

1. **Pick a clean boundary.** For CHANGELOG, that's slice numbers; for README, that's H2 sections; for archives, that's natural cohorts (slice ranges, content batches, or topical groupings).
2. **Move the bulk to a focused sub-doc.** Examples in this repo:
   - CHANGELOG-Unreleased archived to per-cohort files under [docs/changelog/](docs/changelog/) (`archive-slices-NNN-MMM.md`, `archive-monsters-batch-X.md`, `archive-items-batch-X.md`, `archive-rollup-narrative-X.md`).
   - CHANGELOG released versions split out to [docs/changelog/released-versions.md](docs/changelog/released-versions.md).
   - README "Status" / "Coverage at a glance" / "Known gaps" split out to [docs/status.md](docs/status.md).
   - README "Roadmap" split out to [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).
3. **Leave a pointer** in the original doc — a one-paragraph summary plus a markdown link to the new sub-doc. The pointer should be enough that an agent reading the front-door doc still understands the topology.
4. **Update cross-references.** Every doc that linked to the old structure (sibling archives' "see also" lines, the CHANGELOG pointer block, any source-map mentions) needs to point at the new files. `grep -rn '<old-filename>' docs/ CHANGELOG.md README.md` to find them.
5. **Verify each new sub-doc also fits** the ceiling. Some splits need to be split again. Don't leave a 100 KB archive thinking "it's an archive, agents won't read it whole" — they will.
6. **Add an entry to this slice's CHANGELOG** noting the split, so a future reader can trace why files moved.

**Where pointers live:** the live CHANGELOG.md has an in-file pointer block listing every archive; the live README.md has prose summaries pointing to docs/status.md and docs/roadmap.md. When you split a new doc, decide where its pointer belongs (usually the parent that previously contained the content) and add it there.

### Pre-commit checks

Run all of these before committing. Each is mandatory:

- `npx tsc --noEmit` — vitest does not typecheck. Always run this separately.
- `npx vitest run` — full suite. Must be green.
- `npx vitest run -u` — only when adding wired conditions, items, or other content that feeds the coverage snapshot at [tests/coverage/__snapshots__/](tests/coverage/__snapshots__/). Inspect the diff to confirm only intentional additions land.

If a check fails, fix the cause. Never `--no-verify` or skip.

## Goal

**Full mechanical coverage of˜ the 2024 PHB + DMG + MM.** The engine models every printed mechanic: every class, subclass, species, background, feat, spell, weapon, armor, magic item, condition, monster statblock. Rules that are genuinely DM-discretion (improvised actions, narrative rulings, houserules) drop to the `CustomEffect` code-handler escape hatch.

This is a long-running build. The roadmap lives in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) as six phases (A: engine mechanics, B: state schemas, C: combat fill-in, D: adoption surface, E: 2024 content, F: optional core extraction). Phases A through E completed at slice 46 (alpha.5). Slice 47 (Phase F, optional `ttrpg-engine-core` extraction) is still unstarted. Work since alpha.5 has been "primitive + canonical user" vocabulary expansion: each slice adds a focused Effect kind, TriggerAction, or planner that unblocks a cohort of currently schema-only content. The exact slice count drifts; check `git log --oneline | head -5` for the latest. The per-primitive future-slice queue and per-spell wired/schema-only catalog live in [docs/starter-pack-gaps.md](docs/starter-pack-gaps.md).

## SRD source of truth

**The local markdown clone at `references/srd-markdown/` is the canonical source for SRD 5.2.1 rules text.** Never fetch 5e content from the web (Roll20 wiki, dndbeyond, third-party sites). The web sources are 2014-PHB-flavored or third-party variants and have introduced drift bugs in past slices.

The drift audit at [tests/audit/srd-drift.test.ts](tests/audit/srd-drift.test.ts) parses the markdown clone and asserts every pack spell, monster, and magic item matches SRD on the script-detectable fields (school, level, components, classes, concentration, ritual, casting time / range / duration, V/S/M presence, AC, HP, CR, ability scores, rarity, attunement, etc.). It skips itself when the clone is absent (e.g., a fresh worktree without the symlink). Slices 177-194 used this same logic ad-hoc and shipped ~310 drift fixes; the harness now catches regressions automatically.

When auditing content (monsters, spells, items, class features, magic items) against RAW, grep `references/srd-markdown/` and treat its text as authoritative. The PDF source at `references/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf` is the original; the markdown is a faithful fork that was spot-checked against the PDF during the monster audit. The markdown ships as a git submodule (slice 245); the PDF stays gitignored.

Layout:
- `references/srd-markdown/classes.md` — class + subclass features tables and body text
- `references/srd-markdown/spells.md` — every SRD 5.2.1 spell, `#### Spell Name` headers
- `references/srd-markdown/monsters.md`, `monsters-A-Z.md` — bestiary
- `references/srd-markdown/magic-items.md` — DMG items
- `references/srd-markdown/character-creation.md` — species, backgrounds, feats
- `references/srd-markdown/rules-glossary.md` — conditions, damage types, generic rules

If `references/srd-markdown/` is empty (fresh clone without `--recurse-submodules`), surface that immediately and run `git submodule update --init --recursive` rather than proceeding with web sources. Never substitute web lookups.

## Engineering standards (internal, not for marketing copy)

The "Quality bar" section above is the user-facing framing. Internally, the engine is held to a library-quality standard: TypeScript strict mode (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`), deterministic replay, plan/commit RNG capture, 80%+ coverage on `src/engine/` `src/derive/` `src/effects/`, golden transcripts on every behavior change, drift-audited content against the SRD markdown clone.

Do not advertise this framing on public-facing surfaces (README, package.json description, repo description, marketing). The work speaks through the code, tests, and transcripts. Quality labels in marketing copy are noise.

## Known gaps (canonical list lives in README)

The engine architecture is locked. Original Phase A–E combat / state / adoption work all shipped at alpha.5. Remaining work falls into three categories:

1. **Engine vocabulary** — focused primitives that each unblock a cohort of currently schema-only content. ~15–25 still on the catalog at [docs/starter-pack-gaps.md](docs/starter-pack-gaps.md) under "Future engine slices."
2. **Content authoring** — most of what's left. The bulk of the MM bestiary (~365 statblocks), most subclasses (~38), the long tail of schema-only spells (~247), the DMG magic-item catalog. None requires engine work, just JSON. See [docs/starter-pack-gaps.md](docs/starter-pack-gaps.md) for the catalog.
3. **Phase F** (optional) — `ttrpg-engine-core` extraction. Unstarted. Only do this if multi-system support becomes a real goal.

For the slice cadence ("primitive + canonical user"), see the "Working norms" section above plus [docs/slice-template.md](docs/slice-template.md) for the per-shape checklist.

## System-agnostic core seam (forward-looking)

dnd-srd-engine has a conceptual split between system-agnostic architecture and D&D-specific rules. Slice 47 (Phase F in the README roadmap) optionally extracts the agnostic layer into a `ttrpg-engine-core` package if multi-system support ever becomes a real goal. The seam is conceptual today, not enforced in code: several files that belong on the agnostic side already bake in D&D specifics. That's fine; Phase A was the right time to ship D&D shapes. The rule going forward is **stop the bleeding, don't fix the past.**

**Genuinely clean today (keep that way):**
- [src/ids.ts](src/ids.ts): branded strings, no D&D coupling.
- [src/engine/replay.ts](src/engine/replay.ts), [commit.ts](src/engine/commit.ts), [undo-redo.ts](src/engine/undo-redo.ts): operate on opaque events.
- [src/schemas/runtime/session.ts](src/schemas/runtime/session.ts): sessions + journal, no D&D concepts.
- [src/schemas/runtime/in-game-time.ts](src/schemas/runtime/in-game-time.ts): minute-counting only.

**Partially coupled today (don't make worse; Slice 47 cleans up):**
- [src/schemas/runtime/currency.ts](src/schemas/runtime/currency.ts): cp/sp/ep/gp/pp hardcoded.
- [src/schemas/runtime/party.ts](src/schemas/runtime/party.ts): clean except the embedded `Currency`.
- [src/content/pack.ts](src/content/pack.ts): D&D content categories baked into the schema shape.
- [src/schemas/predicate.ts](src/schemas/predicate.ts), [formula.ts](src/schemas/formula.ts): machinery is agnostic, vocabulary is D&D.
- [src/engine/apply.ts](src/engine/apply.ts): hardcoded switch over D&D event types.

**Genuinely D&D-specific (no need to abstract):**
- All `src/schemas/content/*` schemas.
- `src/schemas/runtime/character.ts`, `encounter.ts`, `item-instance.ts`, `effect-instance.ts`, `pending-choice.ts`.
- D&D-mechanics event schemas (combat, spellcasting, rest, level-up, action-economy, concentration, attack, checks).
- All reducers, planners, and derivations.
- Effect primitive vocabulary in `src/schemas/effects.ts` (the *pattern* is agnostic; the *primitives* are D&D).

### Rule for new code

- Adding to a **genuinely clean** file: keep it clean. Don't bake in six ability scores, d20+AC, 13 damage types, spell slot architecture, etc. unless there's a concrete D&D reason that won't exist in other systems.
- Adding to a **partially coupled** file: don't deepen the coupling. If you're extending currency, party, the pack loader, predicate/formula DSLs, or the apply dispatcher, prefer shapes that fit a future generic split. Don't refactor preemptively, but don't make Slice 47 worse either.
- Adding to a **D&D-specific** file: build what 5.5e needs. No abstraction required.

The seam doesn't need to be perfect today, just clean enough that Slice 47 is a manageable refactor rather than a rewrite. Don't add to the debt; don't pay it down preemptively either.

## Architecture (locked)

- **Event-sourced.** State changes are events. `apply(state, event) -> state` is pure.
- **Plan/commit split.** `engine.plan(state, intent)` is the only place RNG is consumed; resolution events carry baked rolls. `apply()` never touches RNG. Replays read baked rolls.
- **Effect primitives.** Features are described via a fixed vocabulary of 46 primitives. Wild Shape, Polymorph, Wish and similar drop to code handlers (the `CustomEffect` escape hatch). Canonical list: `EFFECT_KINDS` in [src/schemas/effects.ts](src/schemas/effects.ts).
- **Branded IDs + ULIDs.** Per-kind branded string types (`CharacterId`, `SpellId`, `ItemDefinitionId` versus `ItemInstanceId`, etc.) backed by ULIDs.
- **Normalized state.** Entities live in `Record<Id, Entity>` maps under `CampaignState`, not nested arrays.
- **Immer internally, immutable externally.** `apply()` uses Immer for clean reducers; output is frozen.
- **Zod.** Single source of truth for schemas; types via `z.infer`. Parse at boundaries (loading content, deserializing campaigns). `apply()` trusts types.
- **Schema versioning.** Every persisted doc carries `schemaVersion`. Migration machinery lives in `src/migrations/` from day one.
- **PendingChoice protocol.** Deferred player decisions (ASI vs feat, subclass selection, spell selection, target selection) are first-class. `ChoiceRequired` events install a `PendingChoice` in state; `ChoiceResolved` records the selection; the effect-stack reads resolved choices and applies the selected option's effects to derivations.

## Source map (where things live)

- [src/schemas/events/](src/schemas/events/), event payload schemas (one file per category: attack, combat, action-economy, rest, etc.); aggregated in [src/schemas/events/index.ts](src/schemas/events/index.ts).
- [src/schemas/runtime/](src/schemas/runtime/), persisted-state shapes (campaign, character, encounter, item-instance, etc.).
- [src/schemas/content/](src/schemas/content/), content-pack shapes (classes, species, spells, items, etc.).
- [src/schemas/effects.ts](src/schemas/effects.ts), [predicate.ts](src/schemas/predicate.ts), [formula.ts](src/schemas/formula.ts), effect primitives + DSLs.
- [src/engine/apply.ts](src/engine/apply.ts), the master switch over event types; pure, RNG-free.
- [src/engine/reducers/](src/engine/reducers/), one file per event category; each exports `applyFoo(draft, event)`.
- [src/engine/plan/](src/engine/plan/), planners; the only place RNG is consumed. One file per intent.
- [src/engine/triggers/](src/engine/triggers/), trigger dispatch (Sneak Attack, opportunity attacks, etc.) called from planners post-event.
- [src/engine/replay.ts](src/engine/replay.ts), [commit.ts](src/engine/commit.ts), [undo-redo.ts](src/engine/undo-redo.ts), event-sourced infrastructure.
- [src/derive/](src/derive/), computed-over-state functions (AC, attack bonus, spell slots, ability checks, etc.).
- [src/effects/](src/effects/), `EffectAccumulator` builder and effect-stack composition.
- [src/content/packs/starter-pack.json](src/content/packs/starter-pack.json), the wired SRD content pack.
- [src/handlers/](src/handlers/), `CustomEffect` code handlers (escape hatch for Wild Shape, Wish, etc.).
- [src/index.ts](src/index.ts), the single public barrel.
- [tests/unit/](tests/unit/), reducer + derivation tests.
- [tests/golden/](tests/golden/), end-to-end scenarios + replay-equivalence + transcripts.
- [tests/audit/](tests/audit/), the 48-probe RAW compliance audit (intentionally monolithic).

## Export discipline

`src/index.ts` is the only public barrel. Nothing under `src/internal/` is exported. Anything not re-exported from `src/index.ts` is internal and may change without notice.

## Testing standard

Tests are valued for what they catch, not for ceremony. The bar is high on the layers that protect architectural invariants and rulebook correctness; everything else gets cut.

### Required test layers (value-dense, keep these)

1. **Reducer unit tests** ([tests/unit/reducers/](tests/unit/reducers/)). One file per event type. Cover the happy path plus every rulebook edge case (damage at 0 HP, temp HP interactions, exhaustion stacking, etc.) and invalid-input rejection. The rulebook lives here as executable code.
2. **Derivation unit tests** ([tests/unit/derive/](tests/unit/derive/)). Table-driven where a rulebook table exists (ability mod, proficiency bonus, spell slot multiclass table). For other derivations, cover the meaningful branches, not every branch.
3. **Golden-file scenarios** ([tests/golden/](tests/golden/)). End-to-end event streams plus expected final state. Doubles as living documentation of how the API is meant to be used.
4. **Replay equivalence** (hard architectural invariant). For every golden scenario: `replay(events).state` deep-equals `campaign.state`. Catches non-determinism in `apply()` reducers.
5. **RNG capture proof** (hard architectural invariant). `apply()` is RNG-free; `ThrowOnCallRNG` test double on `applyAll()` for a planned event stream must not throw. Proves the plan/commit split holds.
6. **Transcript snapshots** ([tests/golden/transcripts/](tests/golden/transcripts/)). Every golden scenario emits a human-readable markdown transcript via `formatTranscript()` from [tests/transcript.ts](tests/transcript.ts) and asserts it against a checked-in file. When a slice changes engine behavior, the transcript diff shows up in the PR alongside the code change. Update transcripts intentionally with `npx vitest run -u`. Use intent-revealing character names in golden tests (`'Alyx'`, `'Goblin A'`) since they appear in the transcript.

### Coverage gates (enforced in [vitest.config.ts](vitest.config.ts))

Single floor of **80% lines + statements** on `src/engine/`, `src/derive/`, `src/effects/`. No global threshold. No per-file 100% targets. Coverage is a smoke alarm, not an accomplishment.

### Explicitly NOT required (cut as ceremony)

- Public API contract snapshot tests. Breaks on every legitimate new export; signal-to-noise is too low.
- Schema round-trip tests. Zod already guarantees parse stability for valid input.
- Effect-primitive coverage matrix as a separate file. Real features are exercised through golden scenarios and reducer tests.
- Property tests at fixed-iteration CI gates. Useful as one-off fuzz runs locally, not as a permanent gate.
- Coverage-filler tests written purely to hit thresholds.

### When adding new code

- New event type: reducer test + at least one golden scenario that uses it + transcript snapshot + a case in [tests/transcript.ts](tests/transcript.ts) `formatEvent`.
- New planner: planner test asserting the resolution chain shape + RNG-capture test if it consumes randomness + golden scenario with transcript.
- New derivation: table-driven tests for rulebook tables, branch tests for the rest.
- New effect primitive: exercised through a real-feature golden scenario, not a coverage-matrix entry.

If a test would only exist to satisfy a coverage threshold, do not write it. Add a test when you can name the bug it prevents.

## Code style

Defers to [~/.claude/CLAUDE.md](../../../.claude/CLAUDE.md) (global) for the full house style. Project-specific additions:

- TypeScript strict mode (enforced in [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`)
- No inline magic numbers/strings: extract to named module-scope constants. The 5.5e rules contain many of these (death-save thresholds, hit die averages, ability score range). Each gets a name.
- No defensive error handling for impossible cases. `invariant()` is for assertions at boundaries (event reducers verifying preconditions before mutating state), not for "this can never happen" checks inside pure helpers.
- Reducers must be small. If `applyFoo` grows past ~30 lines, extract intent-revealing helpers (`absorbTempHP`, `isMassiveDamage`, `resetDeathSaves`). The reducer reads as a sequence of named operations, not a procedure.
- Path alias `@/` = `src/`
- No em dashes or en dashes in any file (comments, docs, error messages). Use commas, parentheses, colons, or separate sentences.

## Versioning

- Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-pre-alpha|-alpha|-beta]`
- Bump on meaningful surface changes, not on every commit.
- `SCHEMA_VERSION` (in [src/version.ts](src/version.ts)) is independent of package version. Bump only when persisted shapes change, and ship a migration in the same PR.

## Parallel sessions

When engine-slice work and content authoring (monsters, magic items) can both make useful progress, run them in parallel via two git worktrees: engine on `main` in the primary worktree, content on a sibling branch in `../dnd-srd-engine-content`. Both worktrees share `.git` history but hold independent working files. See [docs/parallel-authoring.md](docs/parallel-authoring.md) for setup commands, the file-footprint rules each session must respect, the starter prompt for the content-session Claude chat, and merge/cleanup steps.

## Slice workflow

Each slice typically touches the same set of layers. When working on a new slice:

1. **Event schemas** in [src/schemas/events/](src/schemas/events/). Include intent / resolution / notification events as appropriate. Resolution events carry baked RNG.
2. **Reducers** in [src/engine/reducers/](src/engine/reducers/), one file per event category. Wire into [src/engine/apply.ts](src/engine/apply.ts) (both the import and the switch case, both edits are easy to forget).
3. **Planners** in [src/engine/plan/](src/engine/plan/). RNG-consuming logic lives here, never in reducers.
4. **Public API** in [src/engine/index.ts](src/engine/index.ts) (the `Engine` interface and the `planNs` factory) and re-exports in [src/index.ts](src/index.ts).
5. **Tests**: reducer unit tests, planner tests with RNG-capture proof, at least one golden scenario per slice exercising replay-equivalence.

Common gotchas: forgetting to wire a new case into the apply.ts switch produces an "Unhandled event" runtime error. Forgetting the import causes a `ReferenceError` at apply time, not at typecheck time. The architectural invariant tests catch both but only if a golden scenario actually emits the new event.

For task-shape checklists (new planner vs new content type vs new derivation), see [docs/slice-template.md](docs/slice-template.md).

### Planner shape

Every planner in [src/engine/plan/](src/engine/plan/) follows the same skeleton. New planners should match it unless there's a documented reason not to.

```ts
export interface FooIntent {
  readonly type: 'Foo';
  readonly actorId: string;
  // …other intent fields…
  readonly at?: string; // optional timestamp override
}

export const planFoo = (
  state: CampaignState,
  content: ResolvedContent,
  rng: RNG, // omit if the planner consumes no randomness
  intent: FooIntent,
): ReadonlyArray<Event> => {
  // 1. Resolve referenced entities; throw on unknown IDs.
  const actor = state.characters[intent.actorId];
  if (!actor) throw new Error(`Unknown actor ${intent.actorId}`);

  // 2. Validate preconditions (action economy, resource availability,
  //    blocking conditions, RAW restrictions). Throw with a
  //    user-readable message on violation.
  assertActorCanAct(actor, 'Foo');

  // 3. Resolve `at` once.
  const at = intent.at ?? nowIso();

  // 4. Consume RNG (rollDie, rollAdvantage, etc.). All RNG calls live
  //    in the planner; never in reducers or derivations.

  // 5. Build the event sequence. Emit intent / resolution / notification
  //    events in causal order. Set `causedByEventId` on dependent events.

  // 6. Dispatch triggers via `dispatchTriggers({state, content, rng, event, at})`
  //    after committing intermediate events with `applyAll` if downstream
  //    events depend on post-event state.

  return [/* events in order */];

```

Conventions:
- Intent type uses `readonly` fields and a literal `type` discriminator.
- Throw `Error` with a sentence the consumer could surface; never return error tuples.
- ID-form fields use plain `string` on the intent (consumer-facing); cast to branded IDs only when constructing events.
- `at` defaults to `nowIso()`; pass-through to every emitted event so a single planner call gets one timestamp.
- Wire the planner into [src/engine/plan/index.ts](src/engine/plan/index.ts) and (if part of the public API) into [src/engine/index.ts](src/engine/index.ts) and the convenience surface in [src/engine/conveniences.ts](src/engine/conveniences.ts).

Reference examples: [plan/sacred-weapon.ts](src/engine/plan/sacred-weapon.ts) (small, no RNG), [plan/attack.ts](src/engine/plan/attack.ts) (large, RNG + triggers + multi-event resolution chain).
