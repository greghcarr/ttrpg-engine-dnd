# SRD 5.2.1 monster audit

**Status (as of slice 196):** The findings below are historical (slices 141-149, when the pack carried 118 monsters). All flagged entries were closed during those slices, and slice 195's [tests/audit/srd-drift.test.ts](../tests/audit/srd-drift.test.ts) harness now re-runs the AC / HP / CR / ability-score comparisons on every test run, including the 63 monsters added by lane B (batches 4.1-4.14, pack monster count now 181). The hand-built audit logic captured in this doc is preserved as the design record for the harness.

Audit of the 118 monsters in [src/content/packs/starter-pack.json](../src/content/packs/starter-pack.json) against the SRD 5.2.1 (the official 2024 5e SRD published by WotC under CC-BY-4.0). The audit is the source of truth for an upcoming slice queue that standardizes the entire starter pack on SRD 5.2.1.

The audit is scripted: a Node parser reads the markdown SRD in `references/srd-markdown/` (gitignored), extracts AC / HP / abilities / CR for each H3 stat block, and diffs against the pack JSON. Source-of-truth for the SRD text itself is `references/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf` (also gitignored). Spot-check verification of the markdown fork against the PDF was done at audit time; the markdown is faithful.

## Status counts

| Status | Count | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `exact-match` | 46 | no change |
| `drift` | 56 | refresh stats to SRD 5.2.1 |
| `rename-and-drift` | 9 | rename + refresh stats |
| `non-srd-5.2.1` | 7 | drop from pack |
| **Total** | **118** | |

## Resolution roadmap

| Slice | Scope | Status | Files touched |
|---|---|---|---|
| 141 | Drop 7 non-SRD entries | **done** | starter-pack.json (-7 entries) |
| 142 | Rename + refresh the 9 rename-and-drift entries | **done** | starter-pack.json, starter-pack.test.ts (one `goblin` to `goblin-warrior` id update) |
| 143 | Drift refresh batch 1 of 6 (Aboleth, Adult Black/Blue/Green/Red Dragon, Ankheg, Assassin, Bandit Captain, Bearded Devil, Black Bear) | **done** | starter-pack.json |
| 144 | Drift refresh batch 2 of 6 (Black Pudding, Boar, Bone Devil, Brown Bear, Chain Devil, Constrictor Snake, Couatl, Deva, Dire Wolf, Dretch) | **done** | starter-pack.json |
| 145 | Drift refresh batch 3 of 6 (Druid, Dryad, Earth/Fire Elemental, Frost Giant, Gelatinous Cube, Giant Centipede, Giant Rat, Gibbering Mouther, Gray Ooze) | **done** | starter-pack.json |
| 146 | Drift refresh batch 4 of 6 (Imp, Invisible Stalker, Iron Golem, Lemure, Mage, Ochre Jelly, Ogre, Otyugh, Planetar, Priest) | **done** | starter-pack.json |
| 147 | Drift refresh batch 5 of 6 (Quasit, Satyr, Shadow, Shambling Mound, Skeleton, Solar, Sprite, Stirge, Stone Golem, Storm Giant) | **done** | starter-pack.json |
| 148 | Drift refresh batch 6 of 6 (Triceratops, Unicorn, Wight, Wolf, Young White Dragon, Zombie) | **done** | starter-pack.json |
| 149 | Doc refresh: content-attribution.md rewritten to current audit state, README "60% SRD" headline bumped to ~65%, starter-pack-gaps.md scrubbed of dropped + renamed monster references | **done** | docs only |

**As of slice 148: 111 / 111 starter-pack monsters match SRD 5.2.1 exactly on the audited fields (AC, HP, abilities, CR).** The action / trait / save / resistance / immunity drift checks remain as a follow-up pass (see Audit fields and caveats below).

After this, post-pack count drops from 118 to 111. Combined with the 228 SRD entries we don't ship yet, the new SRD-coverage headline is ~111 / 339 = ~33% by entry count (or higher by frequently-used-in-encounters weighting; the headline math is a Slice 149 decision).

## Bucket 1: drop (7 entries)

Not present in SRD 5.2.1, will not ship in the starter pack.

| Pack id | Pack name | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `beholder` | Beholder | WotC trademark, never in any SRD |
| `mind-flayer` | Mind Flayer | WotC trademark, never in any SRD |
| `orc` | Orc | Was in SRD 5.1, removed from SRD 5.2.1 (Orc is now a playable species in 2024) |
| `apprentice-wizard` | Apprentice Wizard | Volo's Guide entry, not in either SRD |
| `manes` | Manes | Not in SRD 5.2.1 |
| `pixie` | Pixie | Not in SRD 5.2.1 |
| `spined-devil` | Spined Devil | Not in SRD 5.2.1 |

## Bucket 2: rename and refresh (9 entries)

Stat block exists in SRD 5.2.1 under a different name, with updated stats. Pack id and name get updated; stats refreshed.

## Bucket 4: exact match (46 entries)

Pack matches SRD 5.2.1 on all audited fields (AC, HP average + formula, all 6 abilities, CR). No action.

Adult White Dragon, Air Elemental, Allosaurus, Animated Armor, Awakened Shrub, Awakened Tree, Bandit, Barbed Devil, Berserker, Blink Dog, Bulette, Cloud Giant, Commoner, Cultist, Fire Giant, Ghost, Ghoul, Giant Frog, Giant Spider, Giant Wolf Spider, Gladiator, Griffon, Guard, Hill Giant, Knight, Mammoth, Manticore, Mastiff, Noble, Owlbear, Pegasus, Plesiosaurus, Pteranodon, Scout, Shield Guardian, Specter, Spy, Stone Giant, Treant, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Water Elemental, Wraith, Young Black Dragon, Young Blue Dragon, Young Green Dragon, Young Red Dragon.

## Audit fields and caveats

The script compares only the structural fields most likely to drift: AC, HP (average + formula), abilities (STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA), and CR. It does **not** verify:

- Action / trait / reaction text or damage formulas (planner-relevant; checked manually during refresh)
- Skills, saves, senses, languages, immunities, resistances, vulnerabilities (low-frequency drift; checked manually during refresh)
- Speed (low-frequency drift; checked manually during refresh)
- Alignment, size, type (almost never drift; checked manually during refresh)

During each refresh slice (143 through 148), the script's diffs are the starting point but the full SRD entry gets a per-line read before committing. A clean `diffs.length == 0` does not guarantee the entry is fully SRD 5.2.1 compliant on every field; it guarantees the AC/HP/abilities/CR are correct, which is the bulk of what drifts in practice.

## Re-running the audit

The audit script lives at `/tmp/srd-audit.mjs` (one-off, not checked in). To regenerate the JSON:

```bash
node /tmp/srd-audit.mjs
```

When the slice work changes a stat block, re-run the audit and update this doc.
